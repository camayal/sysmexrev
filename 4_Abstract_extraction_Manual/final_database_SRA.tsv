SRA-24	A New Pipeline for Removing Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data, Phylogenomics and Biogeography of Castanea and Hamamelis - a comparison between RAD-seq and Hyb-Seq data	@article{Zhou2021Jun,         author = {Zhou, Wenbin and Soghigian, John and Xiang, Qiu-Yun (Jenny)},         title = {{A New Pipeline for Removing Paralogs in Target Enrichment Data}},         journal = {Systematic Biology},         year = {2021},         month = {Jun},         issn = {1076-836X},         doi = {10.1093/sysbio/syab044},         abstract = {{Target enrichment (such as Hyb-Seq) is a well-established high throughput sequencing method that has been increasingly used for phylogenomic studies. Unfortunately, current widely used pipelines for analysis of target enrichment data do not have a vigorous procedure to remove paralogs in target enrichment data. In this study, we develop a pipeline we call Putative Paralogs Detection (PPD) to better address putative paralogs from enrichment data. The new pipeline is an add-on to the existing HybPiper pipeline, and the entire pipeline applies criteria in both sequence similarity and heterozygous sites at each locus in the identification of paralogs. Users may adjust the thresholds of sequence identity and heterozygous sites to identify and remove paralogs according to the level of phylogenetic divergence of their group of interest. The new pipeline also removes highly polymorphic sites attributed to errors in sequence assembly and gappy regions in the alignment. We demonstrated the value of the new pipeline using empirical data generated from Hyb-Seq and the Angiosperm 353 kit for two woody genera Castanea (Fagaceae, Fagales) and Hamamelis (Hamamelidaceae, Saxifragales). Comparisons of datasets showed that the PPD identified many more putative paralogs than the popular method HybPiper. Comparisons of tree topologies and divergence times showed evident differences between data from HybPiper and data from our new PPD pipeline. We further evaluated the accuracy and error rates of PPD by BLAST mapping of putative paralogous and orthologous sequences to a reference genome sequence of Castanea mollissima. Compared to HybPiper alone, PPD identified substantially more paralogous gene sequences that mapped to multiple regions of the reference genome (31 genes for PPD compared with 4 genes for HybPiper alone). In conjunction with HybPiper, paralogous genes identified by both pipelines can be removed resulting in the construction of more robust orthologous gene datasets for phylogenomic and divergence time analyses. Our study demonstrates the value of Hyb-Seq with data derived from the Angiosperm 353 probe set for elucidating species relationships within a genus, and argues for the importance of additional steps to filter paralogous genes and poorly aligned regions (e.g., as occur through assembly errors), such as our new PPD pipeline described in this study.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=A+New+Pipeline+for+Removing+Paralogs+in+Target+Enrichment+Data%2C+Phylogenomics+and+Biogeography+of+Castanea+and+Hamamelis+-+a+comparison+between+RAD-seq+and+Hyb-Seq+data

Asteraceae are clearly monophyletic, yet resolving phylogenetic relationships within the family has proven difficult, hindering our ability to understand its origin and diversification. Recent molecular clock dating has suggested a Cretaceous origin, but the lack of deep sampling of many genes and representative taxa from across the family has impeded the resolution of migration routes and diversifications that led to its global distribution and tremendous diversity. Here we use genomic data from 256 terminals to estimate evolutionary relationships, timing of diversification(s), and biogeographic patterns. Our study places the origin of Asteraceae at ∼83 MYA in the late Cretaceous and reveals that the family underwent a series of explosive radiations during the Eocene which were accompanied by accelerations in diversification rates. The lineages that gave rise to nearly 95% of extant species originated and began diversifying during the middle Eocene, coincident with the ensuing marked cooling during this period. Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses support a South American origin of the family with subsequent dispersals into North America and then to Asia and Africa, later followed by multiple worldwide dispersals in many directions. The rapid mid-Eocene diversification is aligned with the biogeographic range shift to Africa where many of the modern-day tribes appear to have originated. Our robust phylogeny provides a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the role of the macroevolutionary patterns and processes that generated the enormous species diversity of Asteraceae.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=A+fully+resolved+backbone+phylogeny+reveals+numerous+dispersals+and+explosive+diversifications+throughout+the+history+of+Asteraceae

In evening primroses, a model plant for organelle genetics and population biology, hybrid offspring regularly displays chloroplast-nuclear incompatibility. These incompatibilities affect photosynthesis, a trait under selection in changing environments. Here we show that light-dependent misregulation of the plastid psbB operon (encoding core subunits of photosystem II and the cytochrome b6f complex), can lead to hybrid incompatibility, thus ultimately driving speciation. This misregulation results in an impaired light acclimation response in incompatible plants. Moreover, as a result of their different chloroplast genotypes, the parental lines differ in their photosynthesis performance upon exposure to different light conditions. Significantly, the incompatible chloroplast genome is naturally found in xeric habitats with high light intensities, whereas the compatible one is limited to mesic habitats. Consequently, our data raise the possibility that the hybridization barrier evolved as a result of adaptation to specific climatic conditions.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=A+photosynthesis+operon+in+the+chloroplast+genome+drives+speciation+in+evening+primroses

Within the second clade, sects. Insignes and Tentaculatae are well supported, while geographically defined clades representing Sumatra, Indochina, Peninsular Malaysia, Palawan, Mindanao and Borneo are also consistently recovered.

Differential gene expression controlled by internal and external cues is a major driver of growth and time specific differentiation in plants. Transcriptome analysis is the state-of-the-art method to detect spatio-temporal changes in gene expression during development. Monitoring changes in gene expression at early stages or in small plant organs and tissues requires an accurate technique of tissue isolation, which subsequently results in RNA of sufficient quality and quantity. Laser-microdissection enables such accurate dissection and collection of desired tissue from sectioned material at a microscopic level for RNA extraction and subsequent downstream analyses, such as transcriptome, proteome, genome or miRNA. A protocol for laser-microdissection, RNA extraction and RNA-seq was optimized and verified for three distant angiosperm species: Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), Oryza sativa (Poaceae) and Eschscholzia californica (Papaveraceae). Previously published protocols were improved in processing speed by reducing the vacuum intensity and incubation time during tissue fixation and incubation time and cryoprotection and by applying adhesive tape. The sample preparation and sectioning of complex and heterogenous flowers produced adequate histological quality and subsequent RNA extraction from micro-dissected gynoecia reliably generated samples of sufficient quality and quantity on all species for RNA-seq. Expression analysis of growth stage specific A. thaliana and O. sativa transcriptomes showed distinct patterns of expression of chromatin remodelers on different time points of gynoecium morphogenesis from the initiation of development to post-meiotic stages. Here we describe a protocol for plant tissue preparation, cryoprotection, cryo-sectioning, laser microdissection and RNA sample preparation for Illumina sequencing of complex plant organs from three phyletically distant plant species. We are confident that this approach is widely applicable to other plant species to enable transcriptome analysis with high spatial resolution in non-model plant species. The protocol is rapid, produces high quality sections of complex organs and results in RNA of adequate quality well suited for RNA-seq approaches. We provide detailed description of each stage of sample preparation with the quality and quantity measurements as well as an analysis of generated transcriptomes.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=A+protocol+for+Laser+Microdissection+%28LMD%29+followed+by+transcriptome+analysis+of+plant+reproductive+tissue+in+phylogenetically+distant+angiosperms

Despite their biological prominence and value to humans, the deep asterid phylogeny has not been fully resolved, and the evolutionary landscape underlying their radiation remains unknown. To resolve the asterid phylogeny, we sequenced 213 transcriptomes/genomes and combined them with other data sets, representing all accepted orders and nearly all families of asterids. We show fully supported monophyly of asterids, Berberidopsidales as sister to asterids, monophyly of all orders except Icacinales, Aquifoliales, and Bruniales, and monophyly of all families except Icacinaceae and Ehretiaceae. Novel taxon placements benefited from the expanded sampling with living collections from botanical gardens, resolving hitherto uncertain relationships. The remaining ambiguous placements here are likely due to limited sampling and could be addressed in the future with relevant additional taxa. Using our well-resolved phylogeny as reference, divergence time estimates support an Aptian (Early Cretaceous) origin of asterids and the origin of all orders before the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Ancestral state reconstruction at the family level suggests that the asterid ancestor was a woody terrestrial plant with simple leaves, bisexual, and actinomorphic flowers with free petals and free anthers, a superior ovary with a style, and drupaceous fruits. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) analyses provide strong evidence for 33 WGDs in asterids and one in Berberidopsidales, including four suprafamilial and seven familial/subfamilial WGDs. Our results advance the understanding of asterid phylogeny and provide numerous novel evolutionary insights into their diversification and morphological evolution.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Asterid+phylogenomics%2Fphylotranscriptomics+uncover+morphological+evolutionary+histories+and+phylogenetic+placement+for+numerous+whole+genome+duplications

Here, we attempted to sample all species currently recognized under the name Stellaria to determine which belong to a core Stellaria genus versus which are masquerading under this name and are instead more closely related to one of several outgroup lineages. Phylogenetic relationships inferred with RAD loci were recovered with generally high levels of support, regardless of age of specimens (here up to 98 yr) utilized for molecular work. Analyses resolved a monophyletic, core radiation of Stellaria that is sister to Cerastium and others. Within core Stellaria, of which we sampled ca. 87% of species, we recovered five primary lineages. However, current infrageneric hypotheses are incongruous with phylogenomic data, and most morphology-based infrageneric hypotheses break down in light of these results. Outside of core Stellaria we recovered numerous other species currently ascribed to Stellaria that are in need of revised generic placement. Based on current results, however, we propose several new taxonomic and nomenclatural renovations within core Stellaria and external to this group as contribution towards stabilization of generic boundaries in Alsineae. These modifications include description of a new genus of Caryophyllaceae from eastern Asia, Nubelaria , as well description of a new genus, Rabelera , to accommodate the lineage previously and more widely known as Stellaria holostea. Nine new combinations are proposed in the genera Adenonema, Cerastium, Mesostemma, Nubelaria, Rabelera, and core Stellaria. Additionally, one new status, one new synonymy, and lectotypes for four species are proposed. We estimate core Stellaria to consist of approximately 112 species, a decrease from many other published species counts. Our results lay a robust foundation for future evolutionary, phylogenetic, and morphological comparisons within Stellaria and among relatives.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Biogeography+of+the+genus+Stellaria

However, this may be an illusion created by multiple, morphologically cryptic, asexual lineages, each occupying a relatively small area. In this study we investigate the role of multiple lineages in the biogeography of Myriopteris gracilis Fée (Pteridaceae), a North American apomictic triploid fern species with a particularly large range. METHODS: Range-wide asexuality was assessed by counting spores/sporangium in 606 Myriopteris gracilis specimens from across the species range, and lineage structure was assessed with both plastid DNA sequence and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) SNP datasets. KEY RESULTS: Spore counting of >600 specimens identified no sexual populations, establishing that Myriopteris gracilis is exclusively asexual. The plastid data estimated the crown age of M. gracilis at ca. 2.5 mya and identified two lineages, each largely confined to the eastern or western portions of the range. These groups were further subdivided by the GBS data, revealing at least seven asexual lineages of varying geographic distributions, each occupying a relatively small portion of the total range of M. gracilis. CONCLUSIONS: Although maintained exclusively through asexual reproduction, the broad distribution of Myriopteris gracilis is a compilation of numerous, independently formed asexual lineages. Since no single asexual lineage occupies the full extent of the species distribution, recurrent lineage formation should be considered when evaluating the short-term benefit of asexuality in this taxon and others.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Can+asexuality+confer+a+short+term+advantage%3F+Investigating+apparent+biogeographic+success+in+the+apomictic+triploid+fern+Myriopteris+gracilis

Morphological plasticity and poorly resolved dendrograms have led to the need for well resolved species phylogenies. We hypothesized that whole chloroplast phylogenomics would result in more reliable differentiation between closely related amaranth species. The aims of the study were therefore: to construct a fully assembled, annotated chloroplast genome sequence of Amaranthus tricolor; to characterize Amaranthus accessions phylogenetically by comparing barcoding genes (matK, rbcL, ITS) with whole chloroplast sequencing; and to use whole chloroplast phylogenomics to resolve deeper phylogenetic relationships. We generated a complete A. tricolor chloroplast sequence of 150,027 bp. The three barcoding genes revealed poor inter- and intra-species resolution with low bootstrap support. Whole chloroplast phylogenomics of 59 Amaranthus accessions increased the number of parsimoniously informative sites from 92 to 481 compared to the barcoding genes, allowing improved separation of amaranth species. Our results support previous findings that two geographically independent domestication events of Amaranthus hybridus likely gave rise to several species within the Hybridus complex, namely Amaranthus dubius, Amaranthus quitensis, Amaranthus caudatus, Amaranthus cruentus and Amaranthus hypochondriacus. Poor resolution of species within the Hybridus complex supports the recent and ongoing domestication within the complex, and highlights the limitation of chloroplast data for resolving recent evolution. The weedy Amaranthus retroflexus and Amaranthus powellii was found to share a common ancestor with the Hybridus complex. Leafy amaranth, Amaranthus tricolor, Amaranthus blitum, Amaranthus viridis and Amaranthus graecizans formed a stable sister lineage to the aforementioned species across the phylogenetic trees.

Previous studies suggested that many of the subgenera of Astragalus are not monophyletic and the phylogenetic relationships within the genus are still poorly known. In this study, we sampled 117 accessions of Astragalus and its close relatives, covering 55 sections of the genus plus 30 outgroup taxa to recover the main clades of eastern Asian Astragalus based on sequences of the whole chloroplast genome and 65 chloroplast CDSs. Astragalus is supported to be monophyletic and it is sister to the Oxytropis + Coluteoid clade. Within Astragalus, we recovered ten clades, and the ten clades differ substantially from Bunge’s subgenera. The former segregate genus Astracantha is also monophyletic, but embedded within Astragalus s. str., supporting the merge of the spiny former genus Astracantha with Astragalus. We detected the atpF intron losses in the chloroplast genome of the Oxytropis + Coluteoid clade, i.e., the sister clade to Astragalus. Furthermore, we estimated the ancestral states of the trichome morphology and habit via the Bayesian Binary Method. The medifixed hair type is inferred to have developed at least five times and the annual habit originated at least six times. In addition, Astragalus is estimated to have originated in the mid Miocene (stem age, 16.09 Ma, 95% HPD: 12.46–20.50 Ma). The divergence times of the medifixed hair groups ranged from 4.03 to 0.87 Ma, mostly 2–1 Ma, which are correlated with the estimated phased uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We hypothesize that the uplifts of the QTP, which contributed to aridification in eastern Asia and the adjacent regions, may have accelerated the rapid speciation of Astragalus, especially the xerophilous groups (i.e. the medifixed hair groups).

It has a long history of taxonomic uncertainty, and is repeatedly recovered as polyphyletic within a poorly resolved complex of genera in the Urticeae tribe of the nettle family (Urticaceae). To provide generic delimitations concordant with evolutionary history, we use increased taxonomic and genomic sampling to investigate phylogenetic relationships among Urera and associated genera. A cost-effective two-tier genome-sampling approach provides good phylogenetic resolution by using (i) a taxon-dense sample of Sanger sequence data from two barcoding regions to recover clades of putative generic rank, and (ii) a genome-dense sample of target-enrichment data for a subset of representative species from each well-supported clade to resolve relationships among them. The results confirm the polyphyly of Urera s.l. with respect to the morphologically distinct genera Obetia, Poikilospermum and Touchardia. Afrotropic members of Urera s.l. are recovered in a clade sister to the xerophytic African shrubs Obetia; and Hawaiian ones with Touchardia, also from Hawaii. Combined with distinctive morphological differences between Neotropical and African members of Urera s.l., these results lead us to resurrect the previously synonymised name Scepocarpus Wedd. for the latter. The new species epiphet Touchardia oahuensis T.Wells & A.K. Monro is offered as a replacement name for Touchardia glabra non H.St.John, and subgenera are created within Urera s.s. to account for the two morphologically distinct Neotropical clades.

Bladderworts show an incredible diversity of forms surrounding a defined theme: tiny, bladder-like suction traps on terrestrial, epiphytic, or aquatic plants with a diversity of unusual vegetative forms. Utricularia plants, which are rootless, are also anomalous in physiological features (respiration and carbon distribution), and highly enhanced molecular evolutionary rates in chloroplast, mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal sequences. Despite great interest in the genus, no genomic resources exist for Utricularia, and the substitution rate increase has received limited study. Results Here we describe the sequencing and analysis of the Utricularia gibba transcriptome. Three different organs were surveyed, the traps, the vegetative shoot bodies, and the inflorescence stems. We also examined the bladderwort transcriptome under diverse stress conditions. We detail aspects of functional classification, tissue similarity, nitrogen and phosphorus metabolism, respiration, DNA repair, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Long contigs of plastid and mitochondrial genomes, as well as sequences for 100 individual nuclear genes, were compared with those of other plants to better establish information on molecular evolutionary rates. Conclusion The Utricularia transcriptome provides a detailed genomic window into processes occurring in a carnivorous plant. It contains a deep representation of the complex metabolic pathways that characterize a putative minimal plant genome, permitting its use as a source of genomic information to explore the structural, functional, and evolutionary diversity of the genus. Vegetative shoots and traps are the most similar organs by functional classification of their transcriptome, the traps expressing hydrolytic enzymes for prey digestion that were previously thought to be encoded by bacteria. Supporting physiological data, global gene expression analysis shows that traps significantly over-express genes involved in respiration and that phosphate uptake might occur mainly in traps, whereas nitrogen uptake could in part take place in vegetative parts. Expression of DNA repair and ROS detoxification enzymes may be indicative of a response to increased respiration. Finally, evidence from the bladderwort transcriptome, direct measurement of ROS in situ, and cross-species comparisons of organellar genomes and multiple nuclear genes supports the hypothesis that increased nucleotide substitution rates throughout the plant may be due to the mutagenic action of amplified ROS production.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Comparative+Transcriptome+Analysis+Reveals+Molecular+Evolution+in+the+Carnivorous+Utricularia

In this study, the correlations among these mutational events in chloroplast genomes of species in the eudicot family Malvaceae were investigated. This study also reported chloroplast genome sequences of Hibiscus mutabilis, Malva parviflora, and Malvastrum coromandelianum. These three genomes and 16 other publicly available chloroplast genomes from 12 genera of Malvaceae were used to calculate the correlation coefficients among the mutational events at family, subfamily, and genus levels. In these comparisons, chloroplast genomes were pairwise aligned to record the substitutions and the InDels in mutually exclusive, 250 nucleotide long bins. Taking one among the two genomes as a reference, the coordinate positions of oligonucleotide repeats in the reference genome were recorded. The extent of correlations among repeats, substitutions, and InDels was calculated and categorized as follows: very weak (0.1–0.19), weak (0.20–0.29), moderate (0.30–0.39), and strong (0.4–0.69). The extent of correlations ranged 0.201–0.6 between “InDels and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)”, 0.182–0.513 between “InDels and repeat” and 0.055–0.403 between “SNPs and repeats”. At family- and subfamily-level comparisons, 88%–96% of the repeats showed co-occurrence with SNPs, whereas at the genus level, 23%–86% of the repeats co-occurred with SNPs in same bins. Our findings support the previous hypothesis suggesting the use of oligonucleotide repeats as a proxy for finding the mutational hotspots.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Correlations+among+oligonucleotide+repeats%2C+nucleotide+substitutions+and+insertion+and+deletion+mutations+in+chloroplast+genomes+of+plant+family+Malvaceae

We used the chollas to develop a plastome dataset for phylogeny reconstruction to test species relationships, biogeography, clade age, and morphological evolution. Methods We developed a plastome dataset for most known diploid members of the chollas (42 taxa) as well as for other members of Cylindropuntieae. Paired-end, raw reads from genome skimming were reference-mapped onto a de novo plastome assembly of one species of cholla, Cylindropuntia bigelovii, and were used to build our plastome dataset, which was analyzed using various methods. Results Our plastome dataset resolved the phylogeny of the chollas, including most interspecific and intraspecific relationships. Tribe Cylindropuntieae arose ~18 mya, during the early Miocene in southern South America, and is supported as sister to the South American clade Tephrocacteae. The (Micropuntia (Cylindropuntia + Grusonia)) clade most likely originated in the Chihuahuan Desert region around 16 mya and then migrated into other North American desert regions. Key morphological characters for recognizing traditional taxonomic series in Cylindropuntia (e.g., spiny fruit) are mostly homoplasious. Conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive plastome phylogeny for any clade within Cactaceae. Although the chollas s.l. are widespread throughout western North American deserts, their most recent common ancestor likely arose in the Chihuahuan Desert region during the mid-Miocene, with much of their species diversity arising in the early to mid-Pliocene, a pattern strikingly similar to those found in other western North American desert groups.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Cylindropuntieae+phylogenomics

Here, we utilize the Zea-Tripsacum clade to investigate TE activity and accumulation after a shared polyploidization event. Comparisons of TE evolutionary dynamics in various Zea and Tripsacum species, in addition to two closely related diploid species, Urelytrum digitatum and Sorghum bicolor, revealed variation in repeat content among all taxa included in the study. The repeat composition of Urelytrum is more similar to that of Zea and Tripsacum compared to Sorghum, despite the similarity in genome size with the latter. Although LTR-retrotransposons were abundant in all species, we observed an expansion of the copia superfamily, specifically in Z. mays and T. dactyloides, species that have adapted to more temperate environments. Additional analyses of the genomic distribution of these retroelements provided evidence of biased insertions near genes involved in various biological processes including plant development, defense, and macromolecule biosynthesis. Specifically, copia insertions in Zea and T. dactyloides were significantly enriched near genes involved in abiotic stress response, suggesting independent evolution post Zea-Tripsacum divergence. The lack of copia insertions near the orthologous genes in S. bicolor suggests that duplicate gene copies generated during polyploidization may offer novel neutral sites for TEs to insert, thereby providing an avenue for subfunctionalization via TE insertional mutagenesis.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=EVOLUTIONARY+DYNAMICS+OF+TRANSPOSABLE+ELEMENTS+FOLLOWING+A+SHARED+POLYPLOIDIZATION+EVENT+IN+THE+TRIBE+ANDROPOGONEAE

Our phylogenetic results were largely congruent with previous analyses, but we identified several early diverging nodes characterized by extensive gene tree conflict. For particularly contentious nodes, we present detailed information about the phylogenetic signal for alternative relationships. We also analyzed the frequency of gene duplications, confirmed previously identified whole genome duplications (WGD), and proposed a previously unidentified WGD event within the Didiereaceae. We found that the WGD events were typically associated with shifts in climatic niche but did not find a direct association with WGDs and diversification rate shifts. Diversification shifts occurred within the Portulacaceae, Cactaceae, and Anacampserotaceae, and whereas these did not experience WGDs, the Cactaceae experienced extensive gene duplications. We examined gene family expansion and molecular evolutionary patterns with a focus on genes associated with environmental stress responses and found evidence for significant gene family expansion in genes with stress adaptation and clades found in extreme environments.

METHODS: We produced maximum-likelihood phylogenies of Apocynaceae using 21 plastid loci sampled from 1045 species (nearly 25% of the family) and complete plastomes from 73 species. We reconstructed ancestral states and used model comparisons in a likelihood framework to analyze character evolution across Apocynaceae. KEY RESULTS: We obtained a well-supported phylogeny of Apocynaceae, resolving poorly understood tribal and subtribal relationships (e.g., among Amsonieae and Hunterieae, within Asclepiadeae), rejecting monophyly of Melodineae and Odontadenieae, and placing previously unsampled and enigmatic taxa (e.g., Pycnobotrya). We provide new insights into the evolution of Apocynaceae, including frequent shifts between herbaceousness and woodiness, reversibility of twining, integrated evolution of the corolla and gynostegium, and ancestral baccate fruits.

Three well–supported clades in BCMNV and one supported clade for CABMNV were resolved and in agreement with individual gene trees. Selection pressure analysis within sites and across phylogenetic branches suggested both viruses were evolving independently, but under strong purifying selection, with a slow evolutionary rate. These findings provide valuable insights on the evolution of BCMNV and CABMV genomes and their relationship to other viral genomes globally. The results will contribute greatly to the knowledge gap involving the phylogenomic relationship of these viruses, particularly for CABMV, for which there are few genome sequences available, and inform the current breeding efforts towards resistance for BCMNV and CABMV.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Evolutionary+insights+of+Bean+common+mosaic+necrosis+virus+and+Cowpea+aphid-borne+mosaic+virus+from+the+western+highlands+of+Kenya

Gravitropic stimulation was used as an experimental treatment to alter wood formation and also perturb gene expression. Gene transcript abundances were determined using RNA sequencing of developing wood tissues from upright trees, and from the top (tension wood) and bottom (opposite wood) tissues of gravistimulated trees. A network-based approach was employed to align gene coexpression networks across species based on orthologous relationships. A large-scale, multilayer network was modeled that identified both lineage-specific gene coexpression modules and modules conserved across multiple species. Functional annotation and analysis of modules identified specific regulatory processes associated with conserved modules, including regulation of hormones, protein phosphorylation, meristem development and epigenetic processes.

Understanding the evolutionary trajectories and mechanisms underlying these radiations demands much greater phylogenetic resolution than is currently available for these groups. The neotropical tree genus Inga (Leguminosae) is a good example, with ~300 extant species and a crown age of 2-10 MY, yet over 6kb of plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data gives only poor phylogenetic resolution among species. Here we explore the use of larger-scale nuclear gene data obtained though targeted enrichment to increase phylogenetic resolution within Inga. Transcriptome data from three Inga species were used to select 264 nuclear loci for targeted enrichment and sequencing. Following quality control to remove probable paralogs from these sequence data, the final dataset comprised 259,313 bases from 194 loci for 24 accessions representing 22 Inga species and an outgroup (Zygia). Bayesian phylogenies reconstructed using either all loci concatenated or a subset of 60 loci in a gene-tree/species-tree approach yielded highly resolved phylogenies. We used coalescent approaches to show that the same targeted enrichment data also have significant power to discriminate among alternative within-species population histories in the widespread species I. umbellifera. In either application, targeted enrichment simplifies the informatics challenge of identifying orthologous loci associated with de novo genome sequencing. We conclude that targeted enrichment provides the large volumes of phylogenetically-informative sequence data required to resolve relationships within recent plant species radiations, both at the species level and for within-species phylogeographic studies.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Generating+a+phylogenetic+hypothesis+for+Inga+using+targeted+enrichment+data

Sequence diversity of diploid and tetraploid S. tuberosum exceeded any crop resequencing study to date, in part due to expanded wild introgressions following polyploidy that captured alleles outside of their geographic origin. We identified 2,622 genes as under selection, with only 14–16% shared by North American and Andean cultivars, showing that a limited gene set drove early improvement of cultivated potato, while adaptation of upland (S. tuberosum group Andigena) and lowland (S. tuberosum groups Chilotanum and Tuberosum) populations targeted distinct loci. Signatures of selection were uncovered in genes controlling carbohydrate metabolism, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, the cell cycle, and circadian rhythm. Reduced sexual fertility that accompanied the shift to asexual reproduction in cultivars was reflected by signatures of selection in genes regulating pollen development/gametogenesis. Exploration of haplotype diversity at potato’s maturity locus (StCDF1) revealed introgression of truncated alleles from wild species, particularly S. microdontum in long-day–adapted cultivars. This study uncovers a historic role of wild Solanum species in the diversification of long-day–adapted tetraploid potatoes, showing that extant natural populations represent an essential source of untapped adaptive potential.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Genome+diversity+of+tuber+bearing+Solanum+uncovers+complex+evolutionary+history+and+targets+of+domestication+in+the+cultivated+potato

Previously, inference about hybridization was limited by dependence on morphological data; with the advent of the next-generation sequencing tools for nonmodel organisms, the evolutionary significance of hybridization is more evident. Here, we test classic hypotheses of hybrid origins of two species in the Phlox pilosa complex. Morphological intermediacy motivated the hypotheses that Phlox amoena lighthipei and Phlox pilosa deamii were independent homoploid hybrid lineages derived from P. amoena amoena and P. pilosa pilosa. We use double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing of individuals from throughout the range of these taxa to conduct the most thorough analysis of evolutionary history in this system to date. Surprisingly, we find no support for the hybrid origin of P. pilosa deamii or P. amoena lighthipei. Our data do identify a history of admixture in individuals collected at a contemporary hybrid zone between the putative parent lineages. We show that three very different evolutionary histories, only one of which involves hybrid origin, have produced intermediate or recombinant morphological traits between P. amoena amoena and P. pilosa pilosa. Although morphological data are still an efficient means of generating hypotheses about past gene flow, genomic data are now the standard of evidence for elucidating evolutionary history.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Genomic+analyses+overturn+two+long-standing+homoploid+hybrid+speciation+hypotheses

Using phylogeographic analyses of genome-wide SNPs (34,796 SNPs, 183 individuals) and ecological niche modeling, we inferred population structure, ploidy levels, admixture, and Pleistocene range dynamics of P. tremuloides, and tested several historical biogeographical hypotheses. We found three genetic lineages located mainly in coastal–Cascades (cluster 1), east-slope Cascades–Sierra Nevadas–Northern Rockies (cluster 2), and U.S. Rocky Mountains through southern Canadian (cluster 3) regions of the P. tremuloides range, with tree graph relationships of the form ((cluster 1, cluster 2), cluster 3). Populations consisted mainly of diploids (86%) but also small numbers of triploids (12%) and tetraploids (1%), and ploidy did not adversely affect our genetic inferences. The main vector of admixture was from cluster 3 into cluster 2, with the admixture zone trending northwest through the Rocky Mountains along a recognized phenotypic cline (Utah to Idaho). Clusters 1 and 2 provided strong support for the “stable-edge hypothesis” that unglaciated southwestern populations persisted in situ since the last glaciation. By contrast, despite a lack of clinal genetic variation, cluster 3 exhibited “trailing-edge” dynamics from niche suitability predictions signifying complete northward postglacial expansion. Results were also consistent with the “inland dispersal hypothesis” predicting postglacial assembly of Pacific Northwestern forest ecosystems, but rejected the hypothesis that Pacific-coastal populations were colonized during outburst flooding from glacial Lake Missoula. Overall, congruent patterns between our phylogeographic and ecological niche modeling results and fossil pollen data demonstrate complex mixtures of stable-edge, refugial locations, and postglacial expansion within P. tremuloides. These findings confirm and refine previous genetic studies, while strongly supporting a distinct Pacific-coastal genetic lineage of quaking aspen.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Genotyping-by-sequencing+and+ecological+niche+modeling+illuminate+phylogeography%2C+admixture%2C+and+Pleistocene+range+dynamics+in+quaking+aspen+%28Populus+tremuloides%29

Expansion of production into new areas, development of new cultivars, and concerns about adapting grapevines for changing climates necessitate the use of wild grapevine species in breeding programs. Diversity within Vitis has long been a topic of study; however, questions remain regarding relationships between species. Furthermore, the identity of some living accessions is unclear. Methods This study generated 11,020 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for more than 300 accessions in the USDA-ARS grape germplasm repository using genotyping-by-sequencing. Resulting data sets were used to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among several North American and Eurasian Vitis species, and to suggest taxonomic labels for previously unidentified and misidentified germplasm accessions based on genetic distance. Key Results Maximum likelihood analyses of SNP data support the monophyly of Vitis, subg. Vitis, a Eurasian subg. Vitis clade, and a North American subg. Vitis clade. Data delineate species groups within North America. In addition, analysis of genetic distance suggested taxonomic identities for 20 previously unidentified Vitis accessions and for 28 putatively misidentified accessions. Conclusions This work advances understanding of Vitis evolutionary relationships and provides the foundation for ongoing germplasm enhancement. It supports conservation and breeding efforts by contributing to a growing genetic framework for identifying novel genetic variation and for incorporating new, unsampled populations into the germplasm repository system.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=High-throughput+sequencing+data+clarify+evolutionary+relationships+among+North+American+Vitis+species+and+improve+identification+in+USDA+Vitis+germplasm+collections

The transferred region contains an rpl2 pseudogene and is flanked by plastid sequence in the mitochondrial genome, including an rpoC2 pseudogene, which likely provided the mechanism for HGT back to the plastome through double-strand break repair involving homologous recombination. The plastome insertion is restricted to tribe Asclepiadeae of subfamily Asclepiadoideae, whereas the mitochondrial rpoC2 pseudogene is present throughout the subfamily, which confirms that the plastid to mitochondrial HGT event preceded the HGT to the plastome. Although the plastome insertion has been maintained in all lineages of Asclepiadoideae, it shows minimal evidence of transcription in A. syriaca and is likely nonfunctional.

The mimosoid legumes are a prominent pantropical clade of ~3300 species of woody angiosperms for which previous phylogenies have shown extensive lack of resolution, especially among the species-rich and taxonomically challenging ingoids. METHODS We generated transcriptomes to select low-copy nuclear genes, enrich these via hybrid capture for representative species of most mimosoid genera, and analyze the resulting data using de novo assembly and various phylogenomic tools for species tree inference. We also evaluate gene tree support and conflict for key internodes and use phylogenetic network analysis to investigate phylogenetic signal across the ingoids. RESULTS Our selection of 964 nuclear genes greatly improves phylogenetic resolution across the mimosoid phylogeny and shows that the ingoid clade can be resolved into several well-supported clades. However, nearly all loci show lack of phylogenetic signal for some of the deeper internodes within the ingoids. CONCLUSIONS Lack of resolution in the ingoid clade is most likely the result of hyperfast diversification, potentially causing a hard polytomy of six or seven lineages.

The 5-merous floral pattern was inferred to be the ancestral in Vitaceae, with the 4-merous flowers evolved at least two times in the family. The compound dichasial cyme (cymose with two secondary axes) is ancestral in Vitaceae and the thyrse inflorescence (a combination of racemose and cymose branching) in tribe Viteae is derived.

Using complementary hypothesis and data-driven tests, we found evidence for chimeric plastomes generated by interspecific hybridization and recombination in the clade comprising Norway spruce (P. abies) and 10 other species. Support for interspecific recombination remained after controlling for sequence saturation, positive selection, and potential alignment artifacts. These results reconcile previous conflicting plastid-based phylogenies and strengthen the mounting evidence of reticulate evolution in Picea.

Here we jointly model the evolution of biogeographic ranges, biome affinities, and molecular sequences, while incorporating fossils to estimate a dated phylogeny for all of the 163 extant species of the woody plant clade Viburnum (Adoxaceae) that we currently recognize in our ongoing worldwide monographic treatment of the group. Our analyses indicate that while the major Viburnum lineages evolved in the Eocene, the majority of extant species originated since the Miocene. Viburnum radiated first in Asia, in warm, broad-leaved evergreen (lucidophyllous) forests. Within Asia, we infer several early shifts into more tropical forests, and multiple shifts into forests that experience prolonged freezing. From Asia, we infer two early movements into the New World. These two lineages probably first occupied warm temperate forests and adapted later to spreading cold climates. One of these lineages (Porphyrotinus) occupied cloud forests and moved south through the mountains of the Neotropics. Several other movements into North America took place more recently, facilitated by prior adaptations to freezing in the Old World. We also infer four disjunctions between Asia and Europe: the Tinus lineage is the oldest and probably occupied warm forests when it spread, whereas the other three were more recent and in cold-adapted lineages. These results variously contradict published accounts, especially the view that Viburnum radiated initially in cold forests and, accordingly, maintained vessel elements with scalariform perforations. We explored how the location and biome assignments of fossils affected our inference of ancestral areas and biome states. Our results are sensitive to, but not entirely dependent upon, the inclusion of fossil biome data. It will be critical to take advantage of all available lines of evidence to decipher events in the distant past. The joint estimation approach developed here provides cautious hope even when fossil evidence is limited.

Juan Fernandez is a southern Pacific archipelago consisting of three small oceanic islands located 600-700 km west of the Chilean coastline. Exposed to current cold seasonal oceanic climate, these 5.8-1 Ma old islands harbor a remarkable endemic flora. All known Fernandezian endemic grass species belong to two genera, Megalachne and Podophorus, of uncertain taxonomic adscription. Classical and modern classifications have placed them either in Bromeae (Bromus), Duthieniae, Aveneae/Poeae or Loliinae; however, none of them have clarified their systematic, and evolutionary relationships. Megalachne includes four species, which are endemic to Masatierra (Robinson Crusoe island) (M. berteroniana and M. robinsoniana) and to Masafuera (Alejandro Serkilk island) (M. masafuerana and M. dantonii). The monotypic Podophorus bromoides is a rare endemic species to Masatierra which is only known from its type locality and is currently considered extinct. We have used museomic approaches to uncover the challenging evolutionary history of these endemic grasses and to infer the divergence and dispersal patterns from their ancestors. Genome skimming data were produced from herbarium samples of M. berteroniana and M. masafuerana, and the 163-years old type specimen of P. bromoides, as well as for a collection of 33 species representing the main broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae lineages. Paired-end reads were successfully mapped to plastomes and nuclear ribosomal cistrons of reference Festuca species and used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Filtered ITS and trnTLF sequences from these genomes were further combined with our large Loliinae data sets for accurate biogeographic reconstruction. Nuclear and plastome data recovered a strongly supported fine-leaved Fernandezian clade where Podophorus was resolved as sister to Megalachne. Bayesian divergence dating and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis range evolution analyses estimated the split of the Fernandezian clade from its ancestral southern American Pampas-Ventanian Loliinae lineage in the Miocene-Pliocene transition, followed by long distance dispersal from the continent to the uplifted volcanic palaeo-island of Santa Clara-Masatierra. Consecutive Pliocene-Pleistocene splits and a Masatierra-to-Masafuera dispersal paved the way for in situ speciation of Podophorus and Megalachne taxa.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Museomics+unveil+the+phylogeny+and+biogeography+of+the+neglected+Juan+Fernandez+archipelago+Megalachne+and+Podophorus+endemic+grasses+and+their+connection+with+relict+Pampean-Ventanian+fescues

We applied coalescent-based and maximum likelihood phylogenomic inference approaches to the pilot taxon set, incorporating new and published transcriptome data from additional species. Results The custom panel retrieved ~94% of targets and >80% of full gene length from 88% and 68% of samples, respectively. It has minimal gene overlap with existing panels designed for angiosperm-wide studies and generally recovers longer and more variable targets. Pilot phylogenomic analyses consistently resolve most deep and recent relationships with strong support across analyses and point to revised relationships between the crop species D. alata and candidate crop wild relatives.

Our genus-level study of plastid and mitochondrial gene sets includes a comprehensive sampling of photosynthetic lineages across the order, and provides a framework for investigating clade ages, biogeographic hypotheses and organellar molecular evolution. Using multiple inference methods and both organellar genomes, we recovered mostly congruent and strongly supported relationships within and between families, including the placement of fully mycoheterotrophic Triuridaceae. Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae plastomes have slow substitution rates, contributing to weakly supported plastid-based relationships in Cyclanthaceae. While generally slowly evolving, mitochondrial genomes exhibit sporadic rate elevation across the order. However, we infer well-supported relationships even for slower evolving mitochondrial lineages in Cyclanthaceae. Clade age estimates across photosynthetic lineages are largely consistent with previous studies, are well correlated between the two organellar genomes (with slightly younger inferences from mitochondrial data), and support several biogeographic hypotheses. We show that rapidly evolving non-photosynthetic lineages may bias age estimates upwards at neighbouring photosynthetic nodes, even using a relaxed clock model.

The plant genus Penstemon has been difficult to resolve using Sanger sequence-based markers, leading to the hypothesis that it represents a recent North American radiation. The current study demonstrates the utility of multiplexed shotgun genotyping (MSG), a style of restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), to infer phylogenetic relationships within a subset of species in this genus and provide insight into evolutionary patterns. METHODS: We sampled genomic DNA, primarily from herbarium material, and subjected it to MSG library preparation and Illumina sequencing. The resultant sequencing reads were clustered into homologous loci, aligned, and concatenated into data matrices that differed according to clustering similarity and amount of missing data. We performed phylogenetic analyses on these matrices using maximum likelihood (RAxML) and a species tree approach (SVDquartets). KEY RESULTS: MSG data provide a highly resolved estimate of species relationships within Penstemon. While most species relationships were highly supported, the position of certain taxa remains ambiguous, suggesting that increased taxonomic sampling or additional methodologies may be required. The data confirm that evolutionary shifts from hymenopteran- to hummingbird-adapted flowers have occurred independently many times. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that phylogenomic approaches yielding thousands of variable sites can greatly improve species-level resolution of recent and rapid radiations. Similar to other studies, we found that less conservative similarity and missing data thresholds resulted in more highly supported topologies.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Penstemon+MSG+sequences+for+phylogenomic+analysis

Here, we attempted to sample all species currently recognized under the name Stellaria to determine which belong to a core Stellaria genus versus which are masquerading under this name and are instead more closely related to one of several outgroup lineages. Phylogenetic relationships inferred with RAD loci were recovered with generally high levels of support, regardless of age of specimens (here up to 98 yr) utilized for molecular work. Analyses resolved a monophyletic, core radiation of Stellaria that is sister to Cerastium and others. Within core Stellaria, of which we sampled ca. 87% of species, we recovered five primary lineages. However, current infrageneric hypotheses are incongruous with phylogenomic data, and most morphology-based infrageneric hypotheses break down in light of these results. Outside of core Stellaria we recovered numerous other species currently ascribed to Stellaria that are in need of revised generic placement. Based on current results, however, we propose several new taxonomic and nomenclatural renovations within core Stellaria and external to this group as contribution towards stabilization of generic boundaries in Alsineae. These modifications include description of a new genus of Caryophyllaceae from eastern Asia, Nubelaria , as well description of a new genus, Rabelera , to accommodate the lineage previously and more widely known as Stellaria holostea. Nine new combinations are proposed in the genera Adenonema, Cerastium, Mesostemma, Nubelaria, Rabelera, and core Stellaria. Additionally, one new status, one new synonymy, and lectotypes for four species are proposed. We estimate core Stellaria to consist of approximately 112 species, a decrease from many other published species counts. Our results lay a robust foundation for future evolutionary, phylogenetic, and morphological comparisons within Stellaria and among relatives.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogenetic+Relationships+Within+and+Delimitation+of+the+Cosmopolitan+Flowering+Plant+Genus+Stellaria+L.+%28Caryophyllaceae%29%3A+Core+Stars+and+Fallen+Stars

Traditional molecular systematic approaches utilizing small amounts of sequence data have failed to resolve relationships along the spine of the crown clade, a likely ancient rapid radiation. The previous best estimate of the phylogeny was a five-way polytomy, leaving ambiguous the homology of aggregated pollen in two major lineages, the Periplocoideae, which possess pollen tetrads, and the milkweeds (Secamonoideae plus Asclepiadoideae), which possess pollinia. To assess whether greatly increased character sampling would resolve these relationships, a plastome sequence data matrix was assembled for 13 taxa of Apocynaceae, including nine newly generated complete plastomes, one partial new plastome, and three previously reported plastomes, collectively representing all primary crown clade lineages and outgroups. The effects of phylogenetic noise, long-branch attraction, and model selection (linked versus unlinked branch lengths among data partitions) were evaluated in a hypothesis-testing framework based on Shimodaira–Hasegawa tests. Discrimination among alternative crown clade resolutions was affected by all three factors. Exclusion of the noisiest alignment positions and topologies influenced by long-branch attraction resulted in a trichotomy along the spine of the crown clade consisting of Rhabdadenia + the Asian clade, Baisseeae + milkweeds, and Periplocoideae + the New World clade. Parsimony reconstruction on all optimal topologies after noise exclusion unambiguously supports parallel evolution of aggregated pollen in Periplocoideae (tetrads) and milkweeds (pollinia). Our phylogenomic approach has greatly advanced the resolution of one of the most perplexing radiations in Apocynaceae, providing the basis for study of convergent floral morphologies and their adaptive value.

Northern Andean high-elevation ecosystems, or páramos, host some plant lineages that have experienced the fastest diversification rates, likely triggered by ecological opportunities created by mountain uplifts, local climate shifts, and key trait innovations. However, the mechanisms behind rapid speciation into the new adaptive zone provided by these opportunities have long remained unclear. METHODS We address this issue by studying the Venezuelan clade of Espeletia, a species-rich group of páramo-endemics showing a dazzling ecological and morphological diversity. We performed several comparative analyses to study both lineage and trait diversification, using an updated molecular phylogeny of this plant group. RESULTS We showed that sets of either vegetative or reproductive traits have conjointly diversified in Espeletia along different vegetation belts, leading to adaptive syndromes. Diversification in vegetative traits occurred earlier than in reproductive ones. The rate of species and morphological diversification showed a tendency to slow down over time, probably due to diversity dependence. We also found that closely related species exhibit significantly more overlap in their geographic distributions than distantly related taxa, suggesting that most events of ecological divergence occurred at close geographic proximity within páramos. CONCLUSIONS These results provide compelling support for a scenario of small-scale ecological divergence along multiple ecological niche dimensions, possibly driven by competitive interactions between species, and acting sequentially over time in a leapfrog pattern.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogenetic+signatures+of+ecological+divergence+and+leapfrog+adaptive+radiation+in+Espeletia

One such radiation is the pepper plant family Piperaceae, an early-diverging and mega-diverse lineage that could serve as a model to study the diversification of angiosperms. However, traditional genetic markers lack sufficient variation for such studies, and testing hypotheses on poorly resolved phylogenetic frameworks becomes challenging. Limited genomic data is available for Piperaceae, which contains two of the largest genera of angiosperms, Piper (>2100 species) and Peperomia (>1300 species). To address this gap, we used genome skimming to assemble and annotate whole plastomes (152–161kbp) and >5kbp nuclear ribosomal DNA region from representatives of Piper and Peperomia. We conducted phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses to study plastome evolution and investigate the role of hybridization in this group. Plastome phylogenetic trees were well resolved and highly supported, with a hard incongruence observed between plastome and nuclear phylogenetic trees suggesting hybridization in Piper. While all plastomes of Piper and Peperomia had the same gene content and order, there were informative structural differences between them. First, ycf1 was more variable and longer in Piper than Peperomia, extending well into the small single copy region by thousands of base pairs. We also discovered previously unknown structural variation in 14 out of 25 Piper taxa, tandem duplication of the trnH-GUG gene resulting in an expanded large single copy region. Other early-diverging angiosperms have a duplicated trnH-GUG, but the specific rearrangement we found is unique to Piper and serves to refine knowledge of relationships among early-diverging angiosperms.

Despite numerous studies seeking to elucidate the evolutionary relationships of these lineages, relatively few have sought to infer specific patterns of gene flow despite evidence of widespread hybridization. Methods To explore the utility of phylogenomic data for reassessing phylogenetic relationships and inferring patterns of gene flow among species of Achimenes, we sequenced 12 transcriptomes. We used a variety of methods to infer the species tree, examine gene tree discordance, and infer patterns of gene flow. Key Results Phylogenomic analyses resolve clade relationships at the crown of the lineage with strong support. In contrast to previous analyses, we recovered strong support for several new relationships despite a significant amount of gene tree discordance. We present evidence for at least two introgression events between two species pairs that share pollinators, and suggest that the species status of Achimenes admirabilis be reexamined. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the utility of transcriptome data for phylogenomic analyses, and inferring patterns of gene flow despite gene tree discordance. Moreover, these data provide another example of prevalent interspecific gene flow among Neotropical plants that share pollinators.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogenomic+analyses+of+gene+flow+between+species+of+Achimenes+%28Gesneriaceae%29

One of the major limitations of sweet potato production are viral infections. In this study, we used a combination of whole genome sequences from a field isolate obtained from Kenya and those available in GenBank. Sequences of four sweet potato viruses: Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato virus C (SPVC), Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV) were obtained from the Kenyan sample. SPFMV sequences both from this study and from GenBank were found to be recombinant. Recombination breakpoints were found within the Nla-Pro, coat protein and P1 genes. The SPCSV, SPVC, and SPCFV viruses from this study were non-recombinant. Bayesian phylogenomic relationships across whole genome trees showed variation in the number of well-supported clades; within SPCSV (RNA1 and RNA2) and SPFMV two well-supported clades (I and II) were resolved. The SPCFV tree resolved three well-supported clades (I–III) while four well-supported clades were resolved in SPVC (I–IV). Similar clades were resolved within the coalescent species trees. However, there were disagreements between the clades resolved in the gene trees compared to those from the whole genome tree and coalescent species trees. However the coat protein gene tree of SPCSV and SPCFV resolved similar clades to the genome and coalescent species tree while this was not the case in SPFMV and SPVC. In addition, we report variation in selective pressure within sites of individual genes across all four viruses; overall all viruses were under purifying selection. We report the first complete genomes of SPFMV, SPVC, SPCFV, and a partial SPCSV from Kenya as a mixed infection in one sample. Our findings provide a snap shot on the evolutionary relationship of sweet potato viruses (SPFMV, SPVC, SPCFV, and SPCSV) from Kenya as well as assessing whether selection pressure has an effect on their evolution.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogenomic+relationship+of+sweet+potato+viruses+from+the+western+highlands+of+Kenya

Our species tree analyses recovered four main clades in the genus based on consensus nuclear phylogenies, but in conflict with the plastome phylogeny. A few interspecific relationships remained unresolved within the multiple-species clade because of inconsistent gene trees. Our results indicated that gene flow has been widespread within each clade and also occurred among the four clades during their early divergence. We identified 45 candidate genes with ancient polymorphisms maintained by balancing selection. These genes were mainly associated with mating compatibility, growth and stress resistance. Both gene flow and selection-mediated ancient polymorphisms are prevalent in the genus Populus. These are potentially important contributors to adaptive variation.

To overcome this limitation, we developed here a Gesneriaceae-specific gene capture kit targeting 830 single-copy loci (776,754 bp in total), including 279 genes from the Universal Angiosperms-353 kit. With an average of 557,600 reads and 87.8% gene recovery, our target capture was successful across the family Gesneriaceae and also in other families of Lamiales. From our bait set, we selected the most informative 418 loci to resolve phylogenetic relationships across the entire Gesneriaceae family using maximum likelihood and coalescent-based methods. Upon testing the phylogenetic performance of our baits on 78 taxa representing 20 out of 24 subtribes within the family, we showed that our data provided high support for the phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages, and were able to provide high resolution within more recent radiations. Overall, the molecular resources we developed here open new perspectives for the study of Gesneriaceae phylogeny at different taxonomical levels and the identification of the factors underlying the diversification of this plant group.

(c.50 spp.). However, a well-supported phylogeny of the Neotropical spiral gingers including thorough sampling of proposed species encompassing their full morphologic and geographic variation is lacking, partly due to poor resolution recovered in previous analyses using a small sampling of loci. Here we use a phylogenomic approach to estimate the phylogeny of a sample of Neotropical Costaceae species using a targeted enrichment approach. Baits were designed to capture conserved elements variable at the species level using available genomic sequences of Costus species and relatives. We obtained 832 loci (generating 791,954 aligned base pairs and 31,142 parsimony informative sites) for samples that encompassed the geographical and/or morphological diversity of some recognized species. Higher support values that improve the results of previous studies were obtained when including all the available loci, even those producing unresolved gene trees and having a low proportion of variable sites. Concatenation and coalescent-based species trees methods converge in almost the same topology suggesting a robust estimation of the relationships, even under the high levels of gene tree conflict presented here.

Here, we developed a set of baits covering about 660,000 bp from 275 nuclear genes used for the targeted enrichment based on all but one genus and more than 250 species. Using this novel dataset, we resolved the phylogenetic backbone of Ochnaceae, including that of Ochninae, and we established new relationships. Most importantly, our findings highlight that the neotropical and palaeotropical taxa of Sauvagesia form independent clades, requiring the re-erection of formerly separate genera. Ouratea and Ochna (both Ochninae), by far the most species-rich genera and represented by 120 and 41 species, respectively, came out as monophyletic. In contrast, the third-most species-rich genus, Campylospermum, is polyphyletic in two distinct clades. Ouratea, the only neotropical genus of Ochninae, was sister to the five palaeotropical genera of this subtribe.

The genomes of an increasing number of species, including specimens extracted from natural history collections, are being sequenced at low depth. While these data sets are widely used to analyse organelle genomes, the nuclear fraction is generally ignored. Here we evaluate different reference-based methods to infer phylogenies of large taxonomic groups from such data sets. Using the example of the Oleeae tribe, a worldwide-distributed group, we build phylogenies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained using two reference genomes (the olive and ash trees). The inferred phylogenies are overall congruent, yet present differences that might reflect the effect of distance to the reference on the amount of missing data. To limit this issue, genome complexity was reduced by using pairs of orthologous coding sequences as the reference, thus allowing us to combine SNPs obtained using two distinct references. Concatenated and coalescence trees based on these combined SNPs suggest events of incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization during the diversification of this large phylogenetic group. Our results show that genome-wide phylogenetic trees can be inferred from low-depth sequence data sets for eukaryote groups with complex genomes, and histories of reticulate evolution.

Traditional molecular systematics studies were often impaired by the low levels of variation found in chloroplast markers and the high paralogy of traditional nuclear markers like ITS. Next generation sequencing and novel phylogenomics methods, such as target capture and HybSeq have provided new ways of studying the phylogeny of the family with great success. While the resolution of the backbone of the family is in progress with some results already published, smaller studies focusing on internal clades of the phylogeny are important to increase sampling and allow morphological, biogeography and diversification analysis, as well as serving as basis to test the current infrafamilial classification. Vernonieae is one of the largest tribes in the family, accounting for approximately 1500 species. From the 1970s to the 1990s the tribe went through several reappraisals, mainly due to the splitting of the mega genus Vernonia into several smaller segregates. Only three phylogenetic studies focusing on the Vernonieae have been published to date, both using a few molecular markers, overall presenting low resolution and support in deepest nodes, and presenting conflicting topologies when compared. In this study, we present a first attempt at studying the phylogeny of Vernonieae using phylogenomics. Even though our sampling includes only around 4% of the diversity of the tribe, we achieved complete resolution of the phylogeny with high support recovering approximately 700 nuclear markers obtained through target capture.

Sequence capture using anchored hybrid enrichment was employed across 95 species of the clade along with five outgroups and generated sequences of 524 nuclear genes and a partial plastome. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were conducted on concatenated supermatrices, and coalescent-based species tree analyses were run on the gene trees, followed by hybridization network, age diversification and biogeographic analyses. The four tribes Clinantheae, Eucharideae, Eustephieae, and Hymenocallideae (sister to Clinantheae) are resolved in all analyses with > 90 and mostly 100% support, as are almost all genera within them. Nuclear gene supermatrix and species tree results were largely in concordance; however, some instances of cytonuclear discordance were evident. Hybridization network analysis identified significant reticulation in Clinanthus, Hymenocallis, Stenomesson and the subclade of Eucharideae comprising Eucharis, Caliphruria, and Urceolina. Our data support a previous treatment of the latter as a single genus, Urceolina, with the addition of Eucrosia dodsonii. Biogeographic analysis and penalized likelihood age estimation suggests an origin in the Cauca, Desert and Puna Neotropical bioprovinces for the complex in the mid-Oligocene, with more dispersals than vicariances in its history, but no extinctions. Hymenocallis represents the only instance of long-distance vicariance from the tropical Andean origin of its tribe Hymenocallideae. The absence of extinctions correlates with the lack of diversification rate shifts within the clade. The Eucharideae experienced a sudden lineage radiation ca. 10 Mya. We tie much of the divergences in the Andean-centered lineages to the rise of the Andes, and suggest that the Amotape—Huancabamba Zone functioned as both a corridor (dispersal) and a barrier to migration (vicariance).

To test taxonomic hypotheses and utility of characters emphasized in past treatments, we present the first densely sampled molecular phylogenies of Perityleae and reconstruct trait and chromosome evolution. We inferred phylogenetic trees from whole chloroplast genomes, nuclear ribosomal cistrons, and hundreds of low-copy nuclear genes using genome skimming and target capture. Discordance between sources of molecular data suggests an underappreciated history of hybridization in Perityleae. Phylogenies support the monophyly of subtribe Peritylinae, a distinctive group possessing a four-lobed disc corolla; however, all of the phylogenetic trees generated in this study reject the monophyly of the most species-rich genus, Perityle, as well as its sections: Perityle sect. Perityle, Perityle sect. Laphamia, and Perityle sect. Pappothrix. Using reversible jump MCMC, our results suggest that morphological characters traditionally used to classify members of Perityleae have evolved multiple times within the group. A base chromosome number x = 9 gave rise to higher base numbers in subtribe Peritylinae (x = 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19) through polyploidization, followed by ascending or descending dysploidy. Most taxa constitute a monophyletic lineage with a base chromosome number of x = 17, with multiple neo-polyploidization events.

The genomes of an increasing number of species, including specimens extracted from natural history collections, are being sequenced at low depth. While these data sets are widely used to analyse organelle genomes, the nuclear fraction is generally ignored. Here we evaluate different reference-based methods to infer phylogenies of large taxonomic groups from such data sets. Using the example of the Oleeae tribe, a worldwide-distributed group, we build phylogenies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obtained using two reference genomes (the olive and ash trees). The inferred phylogenies are overall congruent, yet present differences that might reflect the effect of distance to the reference on the amount of missing data. To limit this issue, genome complexity was reduced by using pairs of orthologous coding sequences as the reference, thus allowing us to combine SNPs obtained using two distinct references. Concatenated and coalescence trees based on these combined SNPs suggest events of incomplete lineage sorting and/or hybridization during the diversification of this large phylogenetic group. Our results show that genome-wide phylogenetic trees can be inferred from low-depth sequence data sets for eukaryote groups with complex genomes, and histories of reticulate evolution. This opens new avenues for large-scale phylogenomics and biogeographical analyses covering both the extant and the historical diversity stored in museum collections.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogenomics+using+low-depth+whole+genome+sequencing%3A+a+case+study+with+the+olive+tribe

In this study, we obtained whole-genome sequence data from 41 accessions representing most taxa within subgenus Vitis and aligned these sequences to the Vitis vinifera L. reference genome. We reconstructed deep phylogenetic relationships within subgenus Vitis based on 2068 single-copy orthologous genes, which led to a robust topology with bootstrap support values of 100% for almost all branches. Three main clades are recovered within subgenus Vitis reflecting their continental distribution through North America, Europe, and East Asia, respectively. Our results suggest that the most possible migration route of the East Asian Vitis is from northeastern Asia southward to South Asia and Southeast Asia. The East Asian Vitis seems to have experienced adaptive radiation during the Miocene. This study provides novel insights into the diversification history of the grape genus Vitis.

Morphological delimitation among most western bilberry species is tenuous, and traditionally employed molecular sources of phylogenetic information have yielded insufficient variability. Moreover, these species are hypothesized to have undergone extensive introgression. We used RADseq data analyzed with maximum likelihood species tree estimation and Patterson’s D-statistic analyses to examine the influence of introgression on relationships among Vaccinium myrtillus, V. scoparium, and V. cespitosum. Additionally, we used these data to assess whether the populations of V. myrtillus disjunct between North America and Eurasia are monophyletic and should continue to be recognized as conspecific. Significant genome-wide introgression, as determined through D-statistic analyses, was detected between North American samples of V. myrtillus and V. cespitosum, and to a lesser extent, between V. myrtillus and V. scoparium. No significant D-values were detected between V. scoparium and V. cespitosum. Accessions of Vaccinium myrtillus from Eurasia and North America were recovered as non-monophyletic, prompting our proposed resurrection of V. oreophilum for North American material. The long-assumed sister species relationship between V. oreophilum and V. scoparium was not recovered in our analysis. Instead, V. oreophilum and V. cespitosum were inferred to be sister taxa. This study reveals considerable introgression detectable in the evolutionary history of western North American bilberries and demonstrates the utility of RADseq data to resolve species level relationships in groups that undergo reticulate evolution such as Vaccinium.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogeny+and+Introgression+Among+Three+Western+North+American+Bilberries+%28V.+sect.+Myrtillus%29

Paniceae are also valuable for answering scientific and evolutionary questions about C4 photosynthetic evolution, drought tolerance, and spikelet variation. However, the phylogeny of the tribe remains incompletely resolved. METHODS: Forty-five taxa were selected from across the tribe Paniceae and outgroups for genome survey sequencing (GSS). These data were used to build a phylogenetic tree of the Paniceae based on 102 markers (78 chloroplast, 22 mitochondrial, 2 nrDNA). Ancestral state reconstruction analyses were also performed within the Paniceae using both the traditional and two subtype classification systems to test hypotheses of C4 subtype evolution. KEY RESULTS: The phylogenetic tree resolves many areas of the Paniceae with high support and provides insight into the origin and number of C4 evolution events within the tribe. The recovered phylogeny and ancestral state reconstructions support between four and seven independent origins of C4 photosynthesis within the tribe and indicate which species are potentially the closest C3 sister taxa of each of these events. CONCLUSIONS: Although the sequence of evolutionary events that produced multiple C4 subtypes within the Paniceae remains undetermined, the results presented here are consistent with only a subset of currently proposed models. The species used in this study constitute a panel of C3 and C4 grasses that are suitable for further studies on C4 photosynthesis, bioenergy, food and forage crops, and various developmental features of the Paniceae.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogeny+and+photosynthesis+of+the+grass+tribe+Paniceae

The lineage is placed within the Montiaceae, which in turn is sister to the rest of the Portulacineae (Caryophyllales). Calandrinia occupy two distinct biogeographic regions, one in the Americas (~14 species), and one in Australia (~74 species). Past analyses of the Montiaceae present conflicting hypotheses for the phylogenetic placement and monophyly of Calandrinia, and to date, there has been no molecular phylogenetic analysis of the Australian species. Methods Using a targeted gene enrichment approach, we sequenced 297 loci from multiple gene families across the Montiaceae, including all named and 16 putative new species of Australian Calandrinia, and the enigmatic monotypic genus Rumicastrum. Key Results All data sets and analyses reject the monophyly of Calandrinia, with Australian and New World Calandrinia each comprising distinct and well-supported clades, and Rumicastrum nested within Australian Calandrinia. We provide the first well-supported phylogeny for Australian Calandrinia, which includes all named species and several phrase-named taxa. Conclusions This study brings much needed clarity to relationships within Montiaceae and confirms that New World and Australian Calandrinia do not form a clade. Australian Calandrinia is a longtime resident of the continent, having diverged from its sister lineage ~30 Ma, concurrent with separation of Australia from Antarctica. Most diversification occurred during the middle Miocene, with lowered speciation and/or higher extinction rates coincident with the establishment of severe aridity by the late Miocene.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogeny%2C+evolution%2C+and+biogeographic+history+of+Calandrinia%C2%A0%28Montiaceae%29

In many cases, we have an incomplete picture of the origin of crops in the context of their wild progenitors, particularly with regard to the processes producing observed levels of standing genetic variation. Here, we analyzed sequence diversity in cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and its wild progenitor (common sunflower, also H. annuus) to reconstruct phylogeographic relationships and population genetic/demographic patterns across sunflower. In common sunflower, south-north patterns in the distribution of nucleotide diversity and lineage splitting indicate a history of rapid postglacial range expansion from southern refugia. Cultivated sunflower accessions formed a clade, nested among wild populations from the Great Plains, confirming a single domestication event in central North America. Furthermore, cultivated accessions sorted by market type (i.e., oilseed vs. confectionery) rather than breeding pool, recapitulating the secondary development of oil-rich cultivars during its breeding history. Across sunflower, estimates of nucleotide diversity and effective population sizes suggest that cultivated sunflower underwent significant population bottlenecks following its establishment ~5000 years ago. The patterns inferred here corroborate those from previous studies of sunflower domestication, and provide a comprehensive overview of its evolutionary history.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Phylogeography+of+wild+and+cultivated+sunflower+%28Helianthus+annuus+L.%29

However, most phylogenetic trees for non-model organisms are based on single sequences or just a few regions, using traditional sequencing methods. Techniques for massive parallel sequencing or next generation sequencing (NGS) are an alternative to traditional methods that allow access to hundreds of DNA regions. Here we use this approach to resolve the phylogenetic incongruence found in Polystachya Hook. (Orchidaceae), a genus that stands out due to several interesting aspects, including cytological (polyploid and diploid species), evolutionary (reticulate evolution) and biogeographical (species widely distributed in the tropics and high endemism in Brazil). The genus has a notoriously complicated taxonomy, with several sections that are widely used but probably not monophyletic. Methods We generated the complete plastid genome of 40 individuals from one clade within the genus. The method consisted in construction of genomic libraries, hybridization to RNA probes designed from available sequences of a related species, and subsequent sequencing of the product. We also tested how well a smaller sample of the plastid genome would perform in phylogenetic inference in two ways: by duplicating a fast region and analyzing multiple copies of this dataset, and by sampling without replacement from all non-coding regions in our alignment. We further examined the phylogenetic implications of non-coding sequences that appear to have undergone hairpin inversions (reverse complemented sequences associated with small loops). Results We retrieved 131,214 bp, including coding and non-coding regions of the plastid genome. The phylogeny was able to fully resolve the relationships among all species in the targeted clade with high support values. The first divergent species are represented by African accessions and the most recent ones are among Neotropical species. Discussion Our results indicate that using the entire plastid genome is a better option than screening highly variable markers, especially when the expected tree is likely to contain many short branches. The phylogeny inferred is consistent with the proposed origin of the genus, showing a probable origin in Africa, with later dispersal into the Neotropics, as evidenced by a clade containing all Neotropical individuals. The multiple positions of Polystachya concreta (Jacq.) Garay & Sweet in the phylogeny are explained by allotetraploidy. Polystachya estrellensis Rchb.f. can be considered a genetically distinct species from P. concreta and P. foliosa (Lindl.) Rchb.f., but the delimitation of P. concreta remains uncertain. Our study shows that NGS provides a powerful tool for inferring relationships at low taxonomic levels, even in taxonomically challenging groups with short branches and intricate morphology.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Polystachya+biogeography+using+Next-Generation+Sequencing

Here, we use genome-wide sequence data from a community of Panamanian strangler figs and associated wasp pollinators to estimate the relative contributions of four evolutionary processes generating cophylogenetic patterns in this mutualism: cospeciation, host switching, pollinator speciation, and pollinator extinction. Using a model-based approach adapted from the study of gene family evolution, our results demonstrate the importance of host switching of pollinator wasps at this fine phylogenetic and regional scale. Although we estimate a modest amount of cospeciation, simulations reveal the number of putative cospeciation events to be consistent with what would be expected by chance. Additionally, model selection tests identify host switching as a critical parameter for explaining cophylogenetic patterns in this system.

Genome mergers are often accompanied by significant and rapid alterations of genome size and structure via chromosomal rearrangements and altered dynamics of tandem and dispersed repetitive DNA families. Recent developments in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic methods allow for a comprehensive investigation of the repetitive component of plant genomes. Interpretation of evolutionary dynamics following allopolyploidization requires both the knowledge of parentage and the age of origin of an allopolyploid. Whereas parentage is typically inferred from cytogenetic and phylogenetic data, age inference is hampered by the reticulate nature of the phylogenetic relationships. Treating subgenomes of allopolyploids as if they belonged to different species (i.e., no recombination among subgenomes) and applying cross-bracing (i.e., putting a constraint on the age difference of nodes pertaining to the same event), we can infer the age of allopolyploids within the framework of the multispecies coalescent within BEAST2. Together with a comprehensive characterization of the repetitive DNA fraction using the RepeatExplorer pipeline, we apply the dating approach in a group of closely related allopolyploids and their progenitor species in the plant genus Melampodium (Asteraceae). We dated the origin of both the allotetraploid, Melampodium strigosum, and its two allohexaploid derivatives, Melampodium pringlei and Melampodium sericeum, which share both parentage and the direction of the cross, to the Pleistocene (⁠<<<1.4 Ma). Thus, Pleistocene climatic fluctuations may have triggered formation of allopolyploids possibly in short intervals, contributing to difficulties in inferring the precise temporal order of allopolyploid species divergence of M. sericeum and M. pringlei. The relatively recent origin of the allopolyploids likely played a role in the near-absence of major changes in the repetitive fraction of the polyploids’ genomes. The repetitive elements most affected by the postpolyploidization changes represented retrotransposons of the Ty1-copia lineage Maximus and, to a lesser extent, also Athila elements of Ty3-gypsy family.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Repetitive+DNA+evolution+in+plant+genus+Melampodium

Phylogenetic relationships within such species complexes are often difficult to resolve because of the low variability in traditional molecular loci. Furthermore, biological phenomena responsible for topological incongruence such as Incomplete Lineage Sorting (ILS) and hybridisation complicate the resolution of phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa. In this study, we employ a Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach to disentangle evolutionary relationships within a species complex belonging to the Neotropical orchid genus Cycnoches. This complex includes seven taxa distributed through Central America and the Colombian Chocó, and is nested within a clade estimated to have first diversified in the early Quaternary. Previous phylogenies inferred from few loci failed to provide support for internal relationships within the complex. Our Neighbour-net and coalescent-based analyses inferred from ca. 13,000 GBS loci obtained from 31 individuals belonging to six of the seven traditionally accepted Cycnoches taxa provided a robust phylogeny for this group. The genus Cycnoches includes three main clades that are further supported by morphological traits and geographic distributions. Similarly, a topology reconstructed through maximum likelihood (ML) inference of concatenated GBS loci produced results that are comparable with those reconstructed through coalescence and network-based methods. Our comparative phylogenetic informativeness analyses suggest that the low support evident in the ML phylogeny might be attributed to the abundance of uninformative GBS loci, which can account for up to 50% of the total number of loci recovered. The phylogenomic framework provided here, as well as morphological evidence and geographical patterns, suggest that the six entities previously thought to be different species or subspecies might actually represent only three distinct segregates. We further discuss the limited phylogenetic informativeness found in our GBS approach and its utility to disentangle relationships within recent and rapidly evolving species complexes. Our study is the first to demonstrate the utility of GBS data to reconstruct relationships within young (~2 Ma) Neotropical plant clades, opening new avenues for studies of species complexes that populate the species-rich orchid family.

However, the observation that less than half of all angiosperm families are represented in temperate latitudes suggests internal constraints on the evolution of cold tolerance/avoidance strategies. Similar to angiosperms as a whole, grasses are primarily tropical, but one major clade, subfamily Pooideae, radiated extensively within temperate regions. It is posited that this Pooideae niche transition was facilitated by an early origin of long-term cold responsiveness around the base of the subfamily, and that a set of more ancient pathways enabled evolution of seasonal cold tolerance. To test this, we compared transcriptome-level responses of disparate Pooideae to short-/long-term cold and with those previously known in the subtropical grass rice (Ehrhartoideae). Analyses identified several highly conserved cold-responsive ‘orthogroups’ within our focal Pooideae species that originated successively during the diversification of land plants, predominantly via gene duplication. The majority of conserved Pooideae cold-responsive genes appear to have ancient roles in stress responses, with most of the orthogroups also being sensitive to cold in rice. However, a subgroup of genes was likely co-opted de novo early in the Pooideae. These results highlight a plausible stepwise evolutionary trajectory for cold adaptations across Pooideae.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Successive+Evolutionary+Steps+Drove+Pooideae+Grasses+from+Tropical+to+Temperate+Regions

We investigate evolutionary relationships at the intergeneric level in Vrieseeae and at the intrageneric level in Vriesea s.s. We sampled a comprehensive dataset, including 11 genera of Tillandsioideae and nearly 50% of all known Vriesea spp. Using a genome skimming approach, we obtained a 78 483-bp plastome alignment containing 35 complete and 55 partial protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using maximum-likelihood based on three datasets: (1) the 78 483 bp plastome alignment; (2) the nuclear gene phyC and (3) a concatenated alignment of 18 subselected plastid genes + phyC. Additionally, a Bayesian inference was performed on the second and third datasets. These analyses revealed that Vriesea s.s. forms a well-supported clade encompassing most of the species of the genus.

The use of type or topotypic material in phylogenetic studies is paramount particularly when taxonomy is complex, such as that of Antirrhinum (Plantaginaceae). In this paper, we used topotypic materials of Antirrhinum at the species level (34 species proposed by previous authors), 87 specimens representing the species distribution and > 50,000 informative nucleotide characters (from ~4000 loci) generated by the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique: (i) to test two explicit taxonomic hypotheses widely followed by local taxonomic treatments; (ii) to robustly estimate phylogenetic relationships; (iii) to investigate the evolution of key morphological characters and biogeographic centers of differentiation. Two GBS phylogenies based on two datasets (87 localities and 34 topotypic specimens) revealed that: (1) Sutton’s (1988) taxonomic account is the most congruent with phylogenetic results, whereas division of Antirrhinum into three major clades disagrees with Rothmaler’s (1956) infrageneric classification; (2) monophyly of populations currently included in the same species is primarily supported; (3) the historically recognized A. majus group is not monophyletic; (4) sister-group relationships are robust for eight species pairs; (5) the evolutionary radiation of the 26 species since the Pliocene is estimated given a high rate of diversification (0.53 spp Myr-1); (6) a geographic pattern of speciation is reconstructed, with northern Iberia as the center of early diversification followed by more recent speciation in southeastern Iberia; and (7) multiple acquisitions of key taxonomic characters in the course of Antirrhinum diversification are strongly supported, with no evidence of hybridization between major clades.

The large amount of genomic data now available and statistical tools to analyze them provide unprecedented power for phylogenetic inference. Targeted sequencing has emerged as a strong tool for estimating species trees in the face of rapid radiations, lineage sorting and introgression. Evolutionary relationships in Cyperaceae have been studied mostly using Sanger sequencing until recently. Despite ample taxon sampling, relationships in many genera remain poorly understood, hampered by diversification rates that outpace mutation rates in the loci used. The C4 Cyperus Clade of the genus Cyperus has been particularly difficult to resolve. Previous studies based on a limited set of markers resolved relationships among Cyperus species using the C3 photosynthetic pathway, but not among C4 Cyperus Clade taxa. We test the ability of two targeted sequencing kits to resolve relationships in the C4 Cyperus Clade, the universal Angiosperms-353 kit and a Cyperaceae-specific kit. Sequences of the targeted loci were recovered from data generated with both kits and used to investigate overlap in data between kits and relative efficiency of the general and custom approaches. The power to resolve shallow-level relationships was tested using a summary species tree method and a concatenated maximum likelihood approach. High resolution and support are obtained using both approaches, but high levels of missing data disproportionately impact the latter. Targeted sequencing provides new insights into the evolution of morphology in the C4 Cyperus Clade, demonstrating for example that the former segregate genus Alinula is polyphyletic despite its seeming morphological integrity. An unexpected result is that the Cyperus margaritaceus-Cyperus niveus complex comprises a clade separate from and sister to the core C4 Cyperus Clade. Our results demonstrate that data generated with a family-specific kit do not necessarily have more power than those obtained with a universal kit, but that data generated with different targeted sequencing kits can often be merged for downstream analyses. Moreover, our study contributes to the growing consensus that targeted sequencing data are a powerful tool in resolving rapid radiations.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Targeted+sequencing+of+the+C4+Cyperus+Clade+%28Cyperaceae%29

The first is the duration of domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic evidence indicates that it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples diverged ∼22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (Ne) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low-intensity management by humans before domestication. The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development, and stress responses. In contrast, candidate-selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from that of annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. Using forward simulations, we confirm that clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations but without decreasing fitness.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=The+Evolutionary+Genomics+of+Grape+%28Vitis+vinifera+sp.+vinifera%29+Domestication

Our study places the origin of Asteraceae at ∼83 MYA in the late Cretaceous and reveals that the family underwent a series of explosive radiations during the Eocene which were accompanied by accelerations in diversification rates. The lineages that gave rise to nearly 95% of extant species originated and began diversifying during the middle Eocene, coincident with the ensuing marked cooling during this period. Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses support a South American origin of the family with subsequent dispersals into North America and then to Asia and Africa, later followed by multiple worldwide dispersals in many directions. The rapid mid-Eocene diversification is aligned with the biogeographic range shift to Africa where many of the modern-day tribes appear to have originated. Our robust phylogeny provides a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the role of the macroevolutionary patterns and processes that generated the enormous species diversity of Asteraceae.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=The+Explosive+Diversification+of+the+African+Daisy+Lineages+during+the+Eocene%3A+A+Phylogenomics+Perspective+%28Asteroideae%3A+Astereae%29

Ironically, despite this notoriety, there is a dearth of specific knowledge about nearly all other aspects of poison ivy physiology and ecology. As a means of gaining a more molecular-oriented understanding of poison ivy physiology and ecology, Next Generation DNA sequencing technology was used to develop poison ivy root and leaf RNA-seq transcriptome resources. De novo assembled transcriptomes were analyzed to generate a core set of high quality expressed transcripts present in poison ivy tissue. The predicted protein sequences were evaluated for similarity to SwissProt homologs and InterProScan domains, as well as assigned both GO terms and KEGG annotations. Over 23,000 simple sequence repeats were identified in the transcriptome, and corresponding oligo nucleotide primer pairs were designed. A pan-transcriptome analysis of existing Anacardiaceae transcriptomes revealed conserved and unique transcripts among these species.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Toxicodendron+radicans+%28poison+ivy%29+leaf+and+root+transcriptome+sequencing

Although morphologically distinct, the status of its three genera (Cypringlea, Oreobolopsis and Trichophorum) is controversial because recent phylogenetic studies have suggested they might not be reciprocally monophyletic. However, previous analyses have shown conflicting topologies and consistently poor support due to an initial rapid diversification of the tribe. We analysed restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) data from nearly all species of the clade, combined with five Sanger-based markers (matK, ndhF, rps16, ETS-1f, ITS) sampled extensively within species. This approach allowed us to resolve deep and shallow relationships within Trichophoreae for the first time, despite an anomaly zone spanning several successive short branches that produced considerable gene tree incongruence. Analyses reveal a primary phylogenetic split of the tribe into two clades roughly corresponding to an East Asian-North American disjunction that dates back to the mid-Miocene, with both clades comprised of a mixture of reduced unispicate and larger taxa with highly compound inflorescences. Morphological characters traditionally used in the circumscription of Trichophoreae genera are shown to be homoplasious. Several of these characters correlate best with climatic conditions, with the most reduced species occurring in open habitats at high latitudes and altitudes. Close relatives with highly compound inflorescences are found in temperate or subtropical forest understories. Cypringlea and Oreobolopsis are deeply nested within Trichophorum, and we merge all three genera into a more broadly circumscribed Trichophorum. We also show that Scirpus filipes is another previously unrecognized East Asian species of Trichophorum with highly compound inflorescences.

We specifically tested whether flowering time plays a role in maintaining species isolation. Methods RAD-seq data for 103 individuals were used to infer the species relationships and the genetic structure within each species. Flowering times were compared among species on the basis of historical flowering dates documented by herbarium specimens. Results Within each species, we found a strong relationship between flowering date and latitude, such that southern populations flower earlier than northern ones. In areas of sympatry, the species flower in sequence rather than simultaneously, with flowering dates offset by ≥9 d for all species pairs. In two cases it appears that the offset in flowering times is an incidental consequence of adaptation to differing climates, but in the recently diverged sister species V. prunifolium and V. rufidulum, we find evidence that reinforcement led to reproductive character displacement. Long-term trends suggest that the two northern-most species are flowering earlier in response to recent climate change. Conclusions We argue that speciation in the Lentago clade has primarily occurred through ecological divergence of allopatric populations, but differences in flowering time were essential to maintain separation of incipient species when they came into secondary contact. This combination of factors may underlie diversification in many other plant clades.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Viburnum+lentago+clade+RADseq+data

Here, we focus on the Viburnum nudum complex, a highly variable clade that is widely distributed in eastern North America. Taxonomic treatments have mostly divided this complex into northern (V. nudum var. cassinoides) and southern (V. nudum var. nudum) entities, but additional names have been proposed. We used multiple lines of evidence, including RADseq, morphological, and geographic data, to test how many independently evolving lineages exist within the V. nudum complex. Genetic clustering and phylogenetic methods revealed three distinct groups—one lineage that is highly divergent, and two others that are recently diverged and morphologically similar. A combination of evidence that includes reciprocal monophyly, lack of introgression, and discrete rather than continuous patterns of variation supports the recognition of all three lineages as separate species. These results identify a surprising case of cryptic diversity in which two broadly sympatric species have consistently been lumped in taxonomic treatments. The clarity of our findings is directly related to the dense sampling and high-quality genetic data in this study. We argue that there is a critical need for carefully sampled and integrative species delimitation studies to clarify species boundaries even in well-known plant lineages. Studies following the model that we have developed here are likely to identify many more cryptic lineages and will fundamentally improve our understanding of plant speciation and patterns of species richness.}} }	https://scholar.google.com/scholar?&q=Viburnum+nudum+complex+RADseq+data
